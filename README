RPBA - Robust Parallel Bundle Adjustment

For compilation use cmake / cmake-gui and make


RPBA is controled via the file 

"parameters"


It uses the data format defined in the project "Bundle Adjustment in the Large"

https://grail.cs.washington.edu/projects/bal/

It has been particularly tested with

problem-961-187103-pre.txt

and the largest blocks

problem-3068-310854-pre.txt
problem-4585-1324582-pre.txt
problem-13682-4456117-pre.txt

in https://grail.cs.washington.edu/projects/bal/final.html



A short guide to the file "parameters"

Robust:	      	 1 means that robust estimation is used
Exteval:	 1 means that back projection error is computed, but no adjustment
Threads:	 Number threads - 0 means physically available number

k2:		 1 means that second order radial distortion is estimated		 
k4:		 1 means that fourth order radial distortion is estimated
f:		 1 means that focale length / camera constant is estimated

k24out:		 1 means that the output of PBA can be read

InputDir: 	 Name of input directory
File:            File name with format
